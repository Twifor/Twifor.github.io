                    My name is Yuhan Li, and I was born on December 26, 2000. I earned my Bachelor degree in
                    Computer Science from Tianjin University in September 2022. My research interests lie in the
                    development and implementation of efficient, practical, and robust algorithms to address challenges
                    in various domains, including artificial intelligence, computer networking, and distributed systems.

                    I once participated in International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC) and got Gold Medal (19th
                    rank)
                    in 45th ICPC Asia Regional Contest (Jinan Site). Before that, I got silver medal in 45th ICPC
                    Asia Regional Contest (Kunming Site). For those interested in ICPC and algorithmic challenges, I
                    invite you to visit my <a href="https://twifor.github.io/index_original.html">original
